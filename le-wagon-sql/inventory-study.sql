-- Identifying the PK for our circle_sale table

SELECT product_id,
  COUNT(*) AS nb
FROM `course15.circle_sales` 
GROUP BY product_id
HAVING nb >= 2

SELECT date_date,
  COUNT(*) AS nb
FROM `course15.circle_sales` 
GROUP BY date_date
HAVING nb >= 2

-- product_id and date_date are duplicated. Our PK is a combination of date and product id.

SELECT date_date,
  product_id,
  COUNT(*) AS nb
FROM `course15.circle_sales` 
GROUP BY date_date,
  product_id
HAVING nb >= 2

-- For our circle_stock table

SELECT model_id,
  COUNT(*) AS nb
FROM `course15.circle_stock`
GROUP BY model_id
HAVING nb >= 2
ORDER BY nb DESC

-- model_id is not our PK as it is duplicated due to color and size variations. Our PK will be a combination of those 3 values.

SELECT model_id,
  color,
  size,
  COUNT(*) AS NB
FROM `course15.circle_stock`
GROUP BY model_id,
  color,
  size
HAVING nb >=2

-- Let's create a new product_id column and review our colums for better clarity

SELECT CONCAT(t.model_id,"-",t.color,"-",t.size) AS product_id,
  t.model_id AS product_model,
  t.model_name AS product_name,
  t.color AS color_code,

  t.new AS is_new,
  t.price AS product_price,
  t.forecast_stock,
  t.stock AS current_stock

-- Let's check if there are NULL values for our product-id column

SELECT CONCAT(t.model_id,"-",t.color,"-",t.size) AS product_id,
  t.model_id AS product_model,
  t.model_name AS product_name,

  AND CONCAT(t.model_id,"-",t.color,"-",t.size) IS NULL

-- There 6 rows with NULL values due to some products not having any size

SELECT CONCAT(t.model_id,"-",t.color,"-",IFNULL(t.size,"no-size")) AS product_id,

WHERE TRUE
  AND CONCAT(t.model_id,"-",t.color,"-",t.size) IS NULL

-- Now I'll start enriching the stock table. For the sake of practising I will do it with intermediate tables instead of one single query

-- New colum product_name

SELECT *,
  CONCAT(model_name," ",color_name," ","Size ",IFNULL(size,"no-size")) AS product_name
FROM `wagon-portfolio.course15.circle_stock` AS
